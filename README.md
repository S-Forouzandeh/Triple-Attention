# Dynamic Hypergraph Neural Networks with Triple Attention for Recommendation Systems

This repository contains the implementation of a novel recommendation system that combines dynamic hypergraph neural networks, triple attention mechanisms, and contrastive learning for enhanced recommendation accuracy.

## Overview

Our framework introduces several innovative components:
- Dynamic hypergraph construction with triple attention mechanism
- Hierarchical LightGCN backbone for multi-view learning
- Adaptive edge-dropping view augmentation
- Multi-view contrastive learning representations
